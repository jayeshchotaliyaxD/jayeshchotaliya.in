# 🖋️ The Typography Kit by Sagar Tamang

Typography is 90% of design. I get asked daily about the fonts I use in my reels and builds—so here is the exact toolkit. No gatekeeping, just clean pairs.

### The Essentials

* **Inter (Sans)**
    The king of UI. Clean, highly readable, and perfect for functional elements.

* **Playfair Display (Serif)**
    For when you need high-contrast elegance. I use this for headings to give the UI some soul.

* **Helvetica (Classic)**
    The gold standard for a reason. Use this when you want a neutral, timeless look.

### How to use them
Stick to **two font sizes max** for your layout. Use Inter for your UI/Body and Playfair for your Hero/Headings. That’s the "secret" to the aesthetic.

Keep building.
