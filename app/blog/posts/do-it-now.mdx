Yesterday night at around 11 pm, I was browsing through the internet - like always - scrolling instagram, x, youtube, whatever. And somewhere along the way, I stumbled upon one impressive profile. His portfolio website was minimalist yet classy. It slowly opened a can of worms wherein I started seeings a lot of other people's personal portfolio website. And that's what made me to revamp my - much needed - personal website.

## Motivation

I think comparison is one hell of a motivation. Humans are doomed to compare each other - and there's nothing bad about it. That's what helps us to stay on trend, follow the herd and that leads to higer likelihood of survival in the wilderness.

The phrase 'Do it Now' is just something I thought sounded cliche and maybe that would interest people to click on this link.

This personal portfolio of mine is completely open source - i.e., the code is available for free for anyone to use.

## Tech Stack

It is mostly written in `Next JS`. Designed on `Figma`. Took around 2 hours to design it on figma. I compared and took motivations from 3 to 4 different portoflio sites (including the one mentioned earlier). I used my favourite font `Playfair` as the base primary font and `Manroop` as the secondary font.

I am writing this raw, without any GPT rewrite or grammar correction tools because - I think - in this age of AI, we are starved of authentic content; And this writing will help showcase my authenticity; Whatever I do write is only me writing and there's no AI behind it doing all the thinking.
