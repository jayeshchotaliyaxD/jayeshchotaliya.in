# Getting Started with OPC UA for Industrial IoT

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) has become the de facto standard for industrial equipment data exchange. Here's a practical introduction based on my experience implementing OPC UA at ABB.

## What is OPC UA?

OPC UA provides:
- **Platform independence**: Works on any OS, any hardware
- **Semantic data modeling**: Self-describing data with rich metadata
- **Security built-in**: Encryption, authentication, authorization
- **Pub/Sub support**: For efficient real-time data distribution

## Basic Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  OPC UA     │     │  OPC UA     │
│  Client     │◄───►│  Server     │
│  (SCADA/HMI)│     │  (Device)   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## Key Concepts

### Address Space
The server exposes an **address space** - a hierarchical structure of nodes representing:
- Variables (sensor readings, setpoints)
- Methods (callable functions)
- Objects (logical groupings)

### Subscriptions
Clients create **subscriptions** to receive data change notifications efficiently, rather than polling.

### Discovery
OPC UA includes built-in **discovery** mechanisms to find servers on the network.

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start with open62541**: Excellent open-source C library
2. **Use async patterns**: Industrial systems need non-blocking I/O
3. **Plan your information model**: Good modeling = easier integration
4. **Test with UaExpert**: Free client for debugging

## Recommended Resources

- OPC Foundation specifications
- open62541 documentation
- IEC 62541 standard series
