# The "sagar_builds" Subtitle Automation Guide

If you've seen my 50th reel, you know that retention is all about **visual pace**. One-word-at-a-time subtitles are the industry standard for keeping eyes glued to the screen, but doing it manually is a nightmare.

I built this tool to automate that grind using OpenAI's Whisper. Here is how to set it up on your PC or directly on your phone via Termux.

---

## 🚀 The Logic
The script uses **Whisper (Turbo)** to handle transcription and generates a `.srt` file where every segment is exactly one word. 
* **Punctuation Stripping:** Automatically removes commas for a cleaner look.
* **Industry Standard CLI:** Uses `-i` and `-o` flags for professional workflow.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
You must have **FFmpeg** installed (it handles the audio extraction for the AI).

```bash
# Windows
choco install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

```

### 2. Install the Generator

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/one-word-reel-subtitle-generator.git](https://github.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/one-word-reel-subtitle-generator.git)
cd one-word-reel-subtitle-generator
pip install -U openai-whisper

```

## 💻 Professional Usage (CLI)

No more hardcoding file paths. Run the script from your terminal using these flags:

| Flag | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | Input Video | `-i "my_video.mp4"` |
| `-o` | Output Folder | `-o "~/Downloads"` |
| `-m` | AI Model | `-m turbo` (Fastest) |

**Pro Command:**

```bash
python main.py -i ./vids/reel_50.mp4 -o ./subs -m turbo

```

## 📱 The Termux "Mobile-First" Workflow

Since I’m all about **Local AI on Android**, this tool is fully compatible with Termux. This allows you to generate captions while sitting in a cafe, no laptop required.

### Step 1: Bridge the Storage

Termux is sandboxed. You must give it permission to see your phone's files:

```bash
termux-setup-storage

```

### Step 2: Path Mapping

When running the script in Termux, use these paths:

* **Your Downloads:** `~/storage/downloads/`
* **Your Camera:** `~/storage/dcim/Camera/`

**Termux Execution:**

```bash
python main.py -i ~/storage/downloads/raw_reel.mp4 -o ~/storage/downloads -m base

```

*Note: I recommend the `base` model for Termux to save on RAM.*

## 🎨 Importing to Your Editor

1. **VN Editor:** Tap **Text** > **SRT** > **Import**. Apply a "Pop" animation to the entire track.
2. **CapCut:** Go to **Text** > **Local Captions** > **Upload**. Use "Batch Edit" to style every word simultaneously.

> **Builder Tip:** I usually set the text to **All Caps** and use a bold font like *The Bold Font* or *Komika Axis* to maximize the impact.
