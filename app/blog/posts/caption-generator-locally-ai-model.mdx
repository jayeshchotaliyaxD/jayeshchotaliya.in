# The "sagar_builds" Subtitle Automation Guide

If you've seen my 50th reel, you know that retention is all about **visual pace**. One-word-at-a-time subtitles are the industry standard for keeping eyes glued to the screen, but doing it manually is a nightmare.

I built this tool to automate that grind using OpenAI's Whisper. This guide covers how to run it anywhere—including a full Linux environment inside your Android phone.

If you're more of a visual learner, I recorded the entire mobile setup process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdRA1sbYd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdRA1sbYd4)

## 🚀 The Logic
The script uses **Whisper (Turbo)** to handle transcription and generates a `.srt` file where every segment is exactly one word. 
* **Punctuation Stripping:** Automatically removes commas for a cleaner look.
* **Industry Standard CLI:** Uses `-i` and `-o` flags for a professional workflow.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup (PC/Mac)

### 1. Prerequisites
You must have **FFmpeg** installed (it handles audio extraction for the AI).

```bash
# Windows
choco install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

```

### 2. Install the Generator

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator.git
cd minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator
pip install -U openai-whisper

```

## 📱 The Termux "Ubuntu" Workflow (Android)

To avoid dependency errors on Android, we use **PRoot Distro** to run a real Ubuntu environment inside Termux. This is the most stable way to run AI on mobile.

### Step 1: Install the Linux Environment

Paste these commands in Termux to set up your virtual Linux machine:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install proot-distro -y
proot-distro install ubuntu
termux-setup-storage

```

### Step 2: Login & Setup Linux

Now, "log in" to your new Ubuntu system and install the necessary tools:

```bash
proot-distro login ubuntu

# Now inside Ubuntu:
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install python3 python3-pip ffmpeg git -y

```

### Step 3: Clone the Tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAGAR-TAMANG/minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator.git
cd minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator
pip3 install openai-whisper --break-system-packages

```

## 💻 Usage (CLI)

Run the script using these flags. In Ubuntu (Termux), your phone's files are bridged to the `/sdcard` path.

| Flag | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | Input Video | `-i "/sdcard/Download/video.mp4"` |
| `-o` | Output Folder | `-o "/sdcard/Download/"` |
| `-m` | AI Model | `-m turbo` (Fastest/Best) |

**The Pro Command:**

```bash
python3 main.py -i /sdcard/Download/raw_reel.mp4 -o /sdcard/Download/ -m turbo

```

## 🎨 Importing to Your Editor

1. **VN Editor:** Tap **Text** > **SRT** > **Import**. Apply a "Pop" animation to the entire track.
2. **CapCut:** Go to **Text** > **Local Captions** > **Upload**. Use "Batch Edit" to style every word simultaneously.

> **Builder Tip:** I usually set the text to **All Caps** and use a bold font like *The Bold Font* or *Komika Axis* to maximize the impact.

### 🚀 Final Checklist for the Reel
* **Repo URL:** Ensure the repository `minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator` is set to **Public** before you post the Reel.
* **The Folder Name:** Note that the `git clone` creates a folder named `minimalist-one-word-subtitle-generator`, but in your previous draft, you used a different name. I've updated the `cd` command to match the repo name exactly.
* **The `pip3` Flag:** I added `--break-system-packages` because newer versions of Ubuntu (inside PRoot) block global pip installs. This flag is the quickest "hacker fix" for your followers.

**Would you like me to help you draft the GitHub README for this project so the landing page looks as good as this guide?**
