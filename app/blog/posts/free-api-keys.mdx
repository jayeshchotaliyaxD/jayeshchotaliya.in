### 💡 Quick Tips for Setup:

* **Secondary Device:** Use an old Android phone if possible to keep your primary phone free.
* **Battery:** Running agents 24/7 is heavy on resources; keep the device plugged in.
* **No Root Needed:** This setup works on standard Android environments via Termux.
* **API Security:** Never share your API keys publicly! Use environment variables.
