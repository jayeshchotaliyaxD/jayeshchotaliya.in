# Project: Pocket AI (Offline DeepSeek on Android)

**Turn your old Android phone into a private, offline AI powerhouse.**

This guide will show you how to run **DeepSeek-R1**, a powerful reasoning (thinking) AI model, directly on your Android device using **Termux**. No internet required after the initial download. No data tracking. 100% Private.

---

## Prerequisites

1.  **Android Phone**: Any decent Android phone (min 4GB RAM recommended).
2.  **Termux App**: A terminal emulator for Android.
    * *Recommended:* Download from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) (The Play Store version is outdated).

---

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Install & Update Termux
Open Termux and run the following command to ensure your package lists are up to date.

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### 2. Install Ollama

Termux now has an official package for Ollama, making installation very easy.

```bash
pkg install ollama
```

> **Note:** If you see an error saying the package is missing or "no such file" later on, try running `pkg reinstall ollama` to fix broken installs.

### 3. Start the AI Server

Ollama needs a background server to handle the AI logic. Run this command to start it in the background:

```bash
ollama serve &
```

* **Tip:** If you see logs appear, just press `Enter` once to get your command prompt back.
* **Important:** You must run this command every time you open Termux before using the AI.

## Running DeepSeek

We will use the **DeepSeek-R1 Distill** model. This is a highly efficient version of the massive DeepSeek model, optimized to run on smaller devices without losing its reasoning capabilities.

* **Explore all models:** [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library/)

### For Standard Phones (Recommended)

Use the **1.5 Billion parameter** version. It is fast, snappy, and works on most phones.

```bash
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b

```

### For High-End Phones (8GB+ RAM)

If you have a powerful device (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2/3), you can try the larger, smarter versions:

```bash
# 7 Billion parameters (Slower, but smarter)
ollama run deepseek-r1:7b

# 8 Billion parameters (Llama-3 based)
ollama run deepseek-r1:8b
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Connection refused" or "Could not connect to running instance"**

* **Fix:** This means the background server isn't running. Run `ollama serve &` again.

**Error: "No such file or directory" when running `ollama**`

* **Fix:** Your installation might be corrupted. Run `pkg reinstall ollama`.

**The model is too slow!**

* **Fix:** Try a smaller model. `tinyllama` is the fastest option available:

```bash
ollama run tinyllama
```

## Why do this?

1. **Privacy:** Your chats never leave your device.
2. **Offline Access:** Works in an airplane, a bunker, or a forest.
3. **Hardware Reuse:** Give that old phone in your drawer a new purpose as a dedicated AI assistant.
