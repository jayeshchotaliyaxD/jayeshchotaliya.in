# 🦞 OpenClaw on Termux: The "Sagar Builds" Guide

Most people run **OpenClaw** on $2,000 Mac Studios or AWS instances. This guide shows you how to run the full Gateway, Browser Control, and WhatsApp/Telegram channels directly on **Android** using **Termux**.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **Android Device:** Android 10 or higher.
* **Termux:** Installed from F-Droid (not Play Store).
  * **API Key:** Use the Gemini API from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys) for a generous free tier. No need for a paid OpenAI or Anthropic subscription to get started.

## 1. Environment Setup

Standard Termux has issues with OpenClaw’s native dependencies. We use `proot-distro` to create a stable Ubuntu environment.

```bash
# Update Termux
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install proot-distro -y

# Install & Login to Ubuntu
proot-distro install ubuntu
proot-distro login ubuntu

```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Inside your new Ubuntu shell, install **Node.js 22** and the global package.

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install curl git build-essential -y

# Install Node 22
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs

# Install OpenClaw globally
npm install -g openclaw@latest

```

## 3. The "Bionic Bypass" (Crucial)

Android's kernel blocks the `os.networkInterfaces()` call, which causes a **System Error 13** crash. We fix this by "hijacking" the Node.js runtime before the bot even starts.

**Create the Hijack Script:**

```bash
cat <<EOF > /root/hijack.js
const os = require('os');
os.networkInterfaces = () => ({});
EOF

```

**Make it permanent for all OpenClaw commands:**

```bash
echo 'export NODE_OPTIONS="-r /root/hijack.js"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

## 4. The Onboarding Wizard

Since we installed globally, you can run the wizard from anywhere. This will link your API keys and pair your WhatsApp/Telegram.

```bash
openclaw onboard

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Gateway Bind:** When the wizard asks for the Gateway Bind, select **Loopback (127.0.0.1)**. Choosing LAN/0.0.0.0 will trigger a crash on non-rooted Android devices.

## 5. Launching the Gateway

To start the engine and see the logs in real-time (perfect for Reel footage):

```bash
openclaw gateway --verbose

```

### 🏁 Verified Commands

Once the gateway is live, use these chat commands in your linked WhatsApp/Telegram:

* `/status` — Check the health of your pocket agent.
* `/think high` — Put the bot in "deep reasoning" mode.
* `/reset` — Clear the current session memory.

If you want to chat using the web gateway, then copy the "token" vlue from the file `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and paste it at openclaw localhost web gateway -> Overview -> Gateway Access -> Gateway Token.

## Pro-Tips

* **Keep it Alive:** Android will kill Termux in the background. Run `termux-wake-lock` in a separate Termux session and disable "Battery Optimization" for Termux.
* **The UI:** Access your dashboard by going to `http://127.0.0.1:18789` in your phone's browser. Get your token using `openclaw config get gateway.auth.token`.
* **Security:** Never show your full API keys or Gateway tokens in your videos. **Revoke the keys used during setup** once you finish filming your "Success" shot.
