# Secure Cloud Connectivity for Industrial Drives

As embedded systems increasingly connect to the cloud, security becomes paramount. In industrial environments, a security breach can mean not just data loss, but physical safety risks and operational downtime.

## The Challenge

Industrial drives and motors traditionally operated in isolated networks. Modern Industry 4.0 requirements demand:
- Remote monitoring and predictive maintenance
- Real-time telemetry and analytics
- Over-the-air firmware updates
- Integration with enterprise systems

## The Solution: TPM + Certificate Authentication

At ABB, we implemented a multi-layered security approach:

### Hardware Root of Trust
Using TPM (Trusted Platform Module), we establish a hardware root of trust. Private keys never leave the secure element, making key extraction practically impossible.

### X.509 Certificates
Device identity is established through X.509 certificates, provisioned during manufacturing and renewed automatically before expiration.

### Azure IoT Hub Integration
The Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS) handles:
- Zero-touch provisioning
- Certificate-based authentication
- Automatic hub assignment based on device attributes

## Results

This architecture enabled:
- **30% reduction** in unplanned downtime through predictive maintenance
- **99.9% uptime** for cloud connectivity
- Compliance with IEC 62443 security standards
