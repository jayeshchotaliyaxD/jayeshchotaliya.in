# AI on Android: The Ultimate Compatibility List

So you want to run AI on your old phone? Most models (like the new GPT-OSS 20B) are too big and will crash your device.

Here is the list of models that **actually** work, categorized by how much RAM your phone has.

---

### 🟢 Tier 1: The "Potato" Phone (3GB - 4GB RAM)
*These models are tiny, fast, and will run on almost anything.*

**1. Qwen 2.5 (0.5B)**
The speed king. It's not a genius, but it replies instantly.
```bash
ollama run qwen2.5:0.5b

```

**2. Llama 3.2 (1B)**
Meta's optimized mobile model. Surprisingly smart for its size.

```bash
ollama run llama3.2:1b

```

**3. TinyLlama (1.1B)**
The classic. Good for basic chat and testing.

```bash
ollama run tinyllama

```

### 🟡 Tier 2: The Sweet Spot (6GB RAM)

*This is where you get real intelligence. These can code, summarize, and reason.*

**1. DeepSeek Coder (1.3B)**
The best for coding questions. If you want your phone to write Python, use this.

```bash
ollama run deepseek-coder:1.3b

```

**2. Qwen 2.5 (1.5B)**
A perfect balance of speed and smarts. Great for general questions.

```bash
ollama run qwen2.5:1.5b

```

**3. Phi-3.5 Mini (3.8B) – *Warning: Heavy***
Microsoft's model. It's very smart but might be slow on older chips. Give it a try!

```bash
ollama run phi3.5

```

---

### 🔴 Tier 3: The Danger Zone (8GB+ RAM Only)

*Only run these if you have a newer phone or a gaming phone.*

**1. Llama 3.2 (3B)**
The standard for mobile AI right now.

```bash
ollama run llama3.2

```

**2. Mistral (7B) - *Heavily Quantized***
You might be able to squeeze this in if you close all background apps.

```bash
ollama run mistral

```

### Quick Troubleshooting

* **"Killed" Error:** Your phone ran out of RAM. Try a smaller model from Tier 1.
* **Slow Speed:** This is normal on old CPUs. Be patient!
* **Heat:** Your phone will get hot. That means it's working.
