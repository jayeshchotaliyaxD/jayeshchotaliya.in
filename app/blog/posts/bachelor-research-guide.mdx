# 🎓 The Research Paper Roadmap by Sagar Tamang

Congratulations on taking the first step toward publishing your first AI research paper. This is the exact toolkit I used to land **5 Best Paper awards** and **20+ citations**.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: The Essential Toolkit

Don't use MS Word. Real research is built on **LaTeX**. It handles formatting, citations, and math perfectly.

* **The Editor:** [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (Browser-based LaTeX editor).
* **My Go-To Template:** [ArXiv LaTeX Template](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/arxiv). This is the gold standard for AI/ML papers. Use this to make your work look professional from day one.

## 🧠 Step 2: The "Secret Sauce" Strategy

Before you write a single line of code, read this document. It contains the **"Motown Chilly Steps"** for writing a research paper. It is, hands down, the best advice I’ve ever found.

* **Read this first:** [The Golden Guide to Research Writing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0T_OEGgSI8OugmFi8084UmUGbDX8Dk4/view)

## 💡 Step 3: The Mindset of a Researcher (Expert Advice)

Research isn't just about writing; it's about how you think. This video features **Dr. Nishanth Chandran**, a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research India. 

His insights into the field of computer science research were a huge inspiration for me when I was starting out. I highly recommend watching this to understand the level of curiosity and rigor required to succeed.

## 📧 Step 4: The "Cold Email" Template

Use this to approach professors at your university. **Pro-tip:** Read one of their recent abstracts before sending this.

> **Subject:** Undergraduate Research Opportunity - [Your Name]
> 
> Dear Professor [Last Name],
> 
> I am [Your Name], a [Year] student in the [Your Department] department. I’ve been following your work on **[Mention their specific research area]** and was particularly interested in your recent paper regarding **[Mention a specific detail]**.
> 
> I am highly interested in AI/ML and would love the opportunity to contribute to any ongoing projects or research problems in your lab. I am familiar with Python and [mention any other skill like PyTorch/Next.js].
> 
> Would you be available for a brief 10-minute meeting this week to discuss any potential openings for an undergraduate researcher?
> 
> Best regards,
> [Your Name]
> [Your LinkedIn/GitHub Link]

## ✅ Step 5: The Literature Review Checklist

My biggest mistake was skipping this. Don't repeat it. For every paper you read, answer these 3 questions:

1. **What specific problem** are they trying to solve?
2. **What is the limitation** of their current approach? (This is where *your* idea comes from).
3. **How are they measuring success** (Accuracy, F1 Score, Latency)?

## 🚀 Final Advice

Research is about **consistency over intensity**. Spend 30 minutes every day reading one abstract. By the end of the month, you’ll know more than 90% of your peers.

**Build. Publish. Repeat.**
