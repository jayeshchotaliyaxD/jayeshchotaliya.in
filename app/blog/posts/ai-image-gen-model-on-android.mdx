# 🚀 Run SDXL Turbo Locally on Android (Offline)

This guide turns your Android phone into an offline AI image generator using **Termux** and **OnnxStream**. 
No cloud. No internet required after setup. No subscription fees.

> **⚠️ Requirements:**
> * **RAM:** 4GB minimum (8GB+ recommended).
> * **Storage:** ~20GB free space (The model weights are heavy).
> * **Time:** ~15-30 minutes (Compilation takes time).

---

## Phase 1: Setup the Linux Environment 🐧

We need a full Linux environment inside Android to compile the engine.

1.  **Open Termux** and update the repositories:
    ```bash
    pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
    ```

2.  Install **proot-distro** and **Ubuntu**:
    ```bash
    pkg install proot-distro
    proot-distro install ubuntu
    ```

3.  Login to Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    proot-distro login ubuntu
    ```

---

## Phase 2: Build the Engine 🛠️

Now we compile the **OnnxStream** inference engine from source code.

1.  **Install Build Tools** (Copy/Paste this entire block):
    ```bash
    apt update && apt install -y build-essential cmake git wget git-lfs
    git lfs install
    ```

2.  **Clone the Engine Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream](https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream)
    cd OnnxStream/src
    ```

3.  **Compile with CMake:**
    *Note: We use `-DMAX_SPEED=OFF` to prevent phone overheating. If you are brave, change it to `ON`.*
    
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DMAX_SPEED=OFF ..
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
    *(Wait for this to finish. It may take 5-10 minutes depending on your phone's CPU).*

## Phase 3: Download the Model Weights 🧠

We need the specific **OnnxStream-compatible** weights for SDXL Turbo. 

1.  **Navigate back to home:**
    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

2.  **Download the Weights (~15GB):**
    *We use the `depth=1` flag to avoid downloading the entire git history.*
    
    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 [https://huggingface.co/AeroX2/stable-diffusion-xl-turbo-1.0-onnxstream](https://huggingface.co/AeroX2/stable-diffusion-xl-turbo-1.0-onnxstream)
    ```
    *(Make sure you are on WiFi. This will take a while.)*

---

## Phase 4: Run the Generator 🎨

Once the download finishes, you are ready to generate.

1.  **Go to your build folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/OnnxStream/src/build
    ```

2.  **Run the Command:**
    Replace `"Cyberpunk City"` with your own prompt.
    
    ```bash
    ./sd --turbo --models-path ~/stable-diffusion-xl-turbo-1.0-onnxstream --prompt "Cyberpunk City, Neon Lights, 8k"
    ```

### 💡 Pro Tips
* **Performance:** The first generation is always slower (it builds lookup tables). Subsequent images will be faster.
* **Heat:** Your phone will get hot. This is normal. It's running on bare metal.
* **Output:** The image will be saved in the `build` folder as `sd_output.png`.
* **Move Image to Gallery:** To see the image in your Android Gallery, move it to your storage:
    ```bash
    cp sd_output.png /sdcard/Download/
    ```

**Troubleshooting:**
* *Error "Killed":* You ran out of RAM. Close other apps.
* *Error "XNNPACK not found":* Ensure you ran `git clone` correctly and internet was active during build.
