## Overview

Designed and implemented a GCC-compliant preprocessor as the first stage of a C compiler. This project was developed during my embedded systems training at Vector India Pvt. Ltd.

## Key Features

- **Macro Expansion**: Full support for `#define` macros with parameter substitution
- **Conditional Compilation**: Handles `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif` directives
- **Header Inclusion**: Processes `#include` directives with proper file path resolution
- **Line Continuations**: Handles backslash line continuations correctly

## Technical Highlights

- Optimized lexical analysis achieving **25% reduction** in preprocessing time
- Implemented efficient hash tables for macro symbol table management
- Proper handling of stringification (`#`) and token pasting (`##`) operators
- Support for predefined macros like `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__DATE__`

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C (ANSI C99)
- **Build System**: Make/GCC
- **Data Structures**: Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Circular Buffers
- **Testing**: Custom test suite with edge case coverage
