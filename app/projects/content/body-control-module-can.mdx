## Overview

Implemented a Body Control Module (BCM) using CAN 2.0A protocol on an ARM7-based LPC2129 microcontroller for automotive applications. This project was developed during my embedded systems training at Vector India Pvt. Ltd.

## Key Features

- **CAN 2.0A Communication**: Full implementation of CAN protocol with proper bit timing configuration
- **Bus Arbitration**: Handled CAN bus arbitration for multi-node communication
- **LED Control**: Vehicle LED control via CAN messages for indicators, headlights, etc.
- **Interrupt-Driven**: ISR-based message handling for real-time responsiveness

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware Setup
- **MCU**: NXP LPC2129 (ARM7TDMI-S core)
- **CAN Transceiver**: MCP2551 or similar
- **I/O**: GPIO for LED control, status indicators

### Software Architecture
- Interrupt-driven CAN message reception and transmission
- Message filtering based on CAN ID for efficient processing
- Bit timing configuration for reliable bus communication
- Error handling for bus-off recovery and error frame detection

## Key Achievements

- Successfully demonstrated multi-node CAN communication
- Achieved reliable message delivery at 500 kbps baud rate
- Implemented proper error detection and recovery mechanisms

## Technologies Used

- **MCU**: ARM7-based LPC2129
- **Protocol**: CAN 2.0A
- **Language**: Embedded C
- **Tools**: Keil MDK, Flash Magic, CAN Analyzer
